# Creating a Google Application for OAuth2 Authentication

This is a step-by-step guide
to creating a Google App from scratch
so that you can obtain the API keys
to add Google OAuth2 Authentication
to your Elixir App.

The guide is checked periodically by the @dwyl team,
but Google are known to occasionally change their UI/Workflow,
so if anything has changed,
[please let us know!](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google/issues)
