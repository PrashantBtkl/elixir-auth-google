# _Why_? ü§∑

We needed a **_much_ simpler**
and **_extensively_ documented** way
to add "_**Sign-in** with **Google**_"
capability to our Elixir App(s). <br />

# _What_? üí≠

An Elixir package that seamlessly handles
Google OAuth2 Authentication/Authorization
in as few steps as possible. <br />
Following best practices for security & privacy
and avoiding complexity
by having sensible defaults for all settings.


> We built a lightweight solution
that only does _one_ thing
and is easy for complete beginners to understand/use. <br />
There were already _several_ available options
for adding Google Auth to apps on
[hex.pm/packages?search=google](https://hex.pm/packages?search=google) <br />
that all added _far_ too implementation steps (complexity)
and had incomplete documentation (**`@doc false`**) and testing. <br />
e.g:
[github.com/googleapis/elixir-google-api](https://github.com/googleapis/elixir-google-api)
which is a
["_generated_"](https://github.com/googleapis/elixir-google-api/blob/master/scripts/generate_client.sh)
client and is considered "experimental". <br />
We have drawn inspiration from several sources
including code from other programming languages to build this package.
This result is _much_ simpler
than anything else
and has both step-by-step instructions
and an _complete working example_ App
including how to encrypt tokens for secure storage
to help you ship your app _fast_.


# _Who_? üë•

This module is for people building apps using Elixir/Phoenix
who want to ship the "Sign-in with Google" feature _faster_
and more maintainably.

It's targetted at _complete_ beginners
with no prior experience/knowledge
of auth "schemes" or "strategies". <br />
Just follow the detailed instructions
and you'll be up-and running in 5 minutes.


# _How_? ‚úÖ

You can add Google Authentication to your Elixir App
using **`elixir_auth_google`** <br />
in under **5 minutes**
by following these **5 _easy_ steps**:

## 1. Add the hex package to `deps` üì¶

Open your project's **`mix.exs`** file
and locate the **`deps`** (dependencies) section. <br />
Add a line for **`:elixir_auth_google`** in the **`deps`** list:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:elixir_auth_google, "~> 1.0.0"}
  ]
end
```

Once you have added the line to your **`mix.exs`**,
remember to run the **`mix deps.get`** command
in your terminal
to _download_ the dependencies.


## 2. Create Google APIs Application OAuth2 Credentials üÜï

Create a Google Application if you don't already have one,
generate the OAuth2 Credentials for the application
and save the credentials as environment variables
accessible by your app.

> **Note**: There are a few steps to creating a set of Google APIs credentials,
so if you don't already have a Google App,
we created the following step-by-step guide
to make it quick and _relatively_ painless:
[create-google-app-guide.md](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google/blob/master/create-google-app-guide.md) <br />
Don't be intimidated by all the buzz-words;
it's quite straightforward.
And if you get stuck, ask for
[help!](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google/issues)


By the end of this step
you should have these two environment variables set:

```yml
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=631770888008-6n0oruvsm16kbkqg6u76p5cv5kfkcekt.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=MHxv6-RGF5nheXnxh1b0LNDq
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't worry, these keys aren't valid.
They are just here for illustration purposes.


## 3. Create a `GoogleAuthController` in your Project üìù

Create a new file called
[`lib/app_web/controllers/google_auth_controller.ex`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google-demo/blob/master/lib/app_web/controllers/google_auth_controller.ex)
and add the following code:

```elixir
defmodule AppWeb.GoogleAuthController do
  use AppWeb, :controller

  @doc """
  `index/2` handles the callback from Google Auth API redirect.
  """
  def index(conn, %{"code" => code}) do
    {:ok, token} = ElixirAuthGoogle.get_token(code, conn)
    {:ok, profile} = ElixirAuthGoogle.get_user_profile(token.access_token)
    conn
    |> render(:welcome, profile: profile)
  end
end
```
This code does 3 things:
+ Create a one-time auth `token` based on the response `code` sent by Google
after the person authenticates.
+ Request the person's profile data from Google based on the `access_token`
+ Render a `:welcome` view displaying some profile data
to confirm that login with Google was successful.


## 4. Create the `/auth/google/callback` Endpoint üìç

Open your **`router.ex`** file
and locate the section that looks like `scope "/", AppWeb do`

Add the following line:

```elixir
get "/auth/google/callback", GoogleAuthController, :index
```

Sample: [lib/app_web/router.ex#L20](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google-demo/blob/4bb616dd134f498b84f079104c0f3345769517c4/lib/app_web/router.ex#L20)



## 5. Add the "Login with Google" Button to your Template ‚ú®

In order to display the "Sign-in with Google" button in the UI,
we need to _generate_ the URL for the button in the relevant controller,
and pass it to the template.

Open the `lib/app_web/controllers/page_controller.ex` file
and update the `index` function:

From:
```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  render(conn, "index.html")
end
```

To:
```elixir
def index(conn, _params) do
  oauth_google_url = ElixirAuthGoogle.generate_oauth_url(conn)
  render(conn, "index.html",[oauth_google_url: oauth_google_url])
end
```

### Update the `page/index.html.eex` Template

Open the `/lib/app_web/templates/page/index.html.eex` file
and type the following code:

```html
<section class="phx-hero">
  <h1>Welcome to Awesome App!</h1>
  <p>To get started, login to your Google Account: <p>
  <a href="<%= @oauth_google_url %>">
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/Kagbzkq.png" alt="Sign in with Google" />
  </a>
</section>
```

# _Done_! üöÄ

The home page of the app now has a big "Sign in with Google" button:

![sign-in-button](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/70202961-3c32c880-1713-11ea-9737-9121030ace06.png)

When the person clicks the button,
and authenticates with their Google Account,
they will be returned to your App
where you can display a "login success" message:

![welcome](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/194400/70201692-494db880-170f-11ea-9776-0ffd1fdf5a72.png)


<br /> <br />

## _Even_ More Detail üí°

If you want to dive a bit deeper into _understanding_ how this package works,
You can read and grok the code in under 10 minutes:
[`/lib/elixir_auth_google.ex`](https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google/blob/master/lib/elixir_auth_google.ex)

We created a _basic_ demo Phoenix App,
to show you _exactly_ how you can implement
the **`elixir_auth_google`** package:
https://github.com/dwyl/elixir-auth-google-demo
It's deployed to Heroku: https://elixir-auth-google-demo.herokuapp.com <br />
(_no data is saved so you can play with it - and try an break it!_)

And if you want/need a more complete real-world example
including creating sessions and saving profile data to a database,

### Fun Facts üìàüìä

Unlike other "social media" companies,
Google/Alphabet does not report it's
_Monthly_ Active Users (MAUs)
or _Daily_ Active Users (DAUs)
however they do release stats in drips
in their Google IO or YouTube events.
The following is a quick list of facts
that make adding Google Auth to your App
a compelling business case:

+ As of May 2019, there are over
[2.5 Billion](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18528297/google-io-2019-android-devices-play-store-total-number-statistic-keynote)
_active_ Android devices;
[87%](https://www.idc.com/promo/smartphone-market-share/os) global market share.
All these people have Google Accounts in order to use Google services.
+ YouTube has
[2 billion](https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/)
monthly active YouTube users (_signed in with a Google Account_).
+ Gmail has
[1.5 Billion](https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/googles-gmail-turns-15-now-has-over-15-billion-monthly-active-users-99275)
monthly active users a
[27% share](https://seotribunal.com/blog/google-stats-and-facts)
 of the global email client market.
+ [65%](https://techjury.net/stats-about/gmail-statistics)
of Small and Medium sized businesses use Google Apps for business.
+ [90%+](https://techjury.net/stats-about/gmail-statistics)
of startups use Gmail. This is a good _proxy_ for "early adopters".
+ [68%](https://eu.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/joannaallhands/2017/10/09/google-classroom-changing-teachers-students-education/708246001/)
of schools in the US use Google Classroom and related G-suite products. <br />
So the _next_ generation of internet/app users have Google accounts.
+ Google has
[90.46%](https://seotribunal.com/blog/google-stats-and-facts/)
of the search engine market share worldwide. 95.4% on Mobile.

Of the 4.5 billion internet users (58% of the world population),
around 3.2 billion (72%) have a Google account.
90%+ of tech "early adopters" use Google Apps
which means that adding Google OAuth Sign-in
is the _logical_ choice for _most_ Apps.

### Privacy Concerns? üîê

A _common misconception_ is that adding Google Auth Sign-in
sends a user's application data to Google.
This is **`false`** and App developers have 100% control
over what data is sent to (stored by) Google.
An App can use Google Auth to _authenticate_ a person
(_identify them and get read-only access
  to their personal details like **first name** and **email address**_)
without sending any data to Google.
Yes, it will mean that Google "knows" that the person is _using_ your App,
but it will not give Google any insight into _how_ they are using it
or what types of data they are storing in the App. Privacy is maintained.
So if you use the @dwyl app to plan your wedding or next holiday,
Google will not have _any_ of that data
and will not serve any annoying ads based on your project/plans.
